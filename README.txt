The purpose of the program is to figure out whether a normal investor can use market-timing strategies to "beat the market". The program uses historical stock market (S&P Composite Index returns) and treasury bill (GS10 interest rates) data from 1871-2017 to compare various market-timing strategies against a simple buy-and-hold strategy to determine the best outcome for a normal investor.
