The purpose of the program is to figure out whether a normal investor who earns a regular paycheck can use market-timing strategies to "beat the market" or if a buy-and-hold strategy works best. The program uses historical stock market (S&P 500 returns) and treasury bill (GS10 interest rates) datafrom 1871-2017 to simulate various investment strategies to determine the best outcome.
